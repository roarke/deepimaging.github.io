Here is some information about the final project:
1. You can work alone or in a group (up to 4 people), required effort will scale with # of people
2. Select a “base” dataset (see examples below)
3. You'll need to simulate parameters of a physical (imaging) system with base dataset
4. You'll then need to train a deep neural net, with simulated dataset, and the physical parameters in mind
5. Please see slides from class for a number of examples and discussions

Here is a link to a template for the final project research-style paper:
[Template for research-style paper](/data/paper_template.zip)

Here is a link to a template for the final project short webpage:
[Template for final project webpage](/data/website_template.zip)

In short, your final report and materials will include the following:
1. A 7-minute presentation with slides that you will give to the class during the final period  
2. A short research-style paper (4 pages minimum, 6 pages maximum) that includes an abstract, introduction, related work, methods, results, a discussion, references and at least 3 figures. 
3. The project’s source code
4. A completed web template containing the main results from the research paper
5. A completed permission form
